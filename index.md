# A core collection of super-enhancers with their unique charactheristics 

## Introduction
This repertoire contains a set of super-enhancers along with typical enhancers and stretch enhancers on selected cell-lines / tissues. In addition, a series of statistical comparisons were carried out between super-enhancers and typical/stretch enhancers. These analyses demonstrate that super-enhancers are a unique subclass of enhancers, with distinct characteristics from typical enhancers and, more importantly, stretch enhancers.  

## Data access
- Super-enhancers and typical enhancers identified based on ChIP-seq data from the ENCODE project   
-- Super-enhancers  
-- Typical enhancers  
** Above are links to bulk downloads, here is an additional table for downloading data of each cell type   

- Super-enhancers, stretch enhancers, and typical enhancers in the ten extensively studies cell lines   
-- Super-enhancers  
-- Stretch enhancers  
-- Typical enhancers  
** Above are links to bulk downloads, here is an additional table for downloading data of each cell type   
  
## Comparison to typical enhancers  
We compared the size and the number of SEs and typical enhancers (TE) in each cell type.

## Comparison to stretch enhancers  
We compared the size and the number of SEs, stretch enhancers (StrE) and typical enhancers (TE) in each cell type.

## Super-enhancer landscape, hierarchical clustering, and principle component analysis  
-- Landscape on chromosomes  
-- Hierarchical clustering based on SE cooccurrence Jaccard distance between paris of samples  
-- Principle component analysis based on SE occurrence matrix on all the samples
