# Unique charactheristics of super-enhancers (SEs)

### Introduction
This repertoire contains a set of super-enhancers along with typical enhancers and stretch enhancers on selected cell-lines / tissues. In addition, a series of statistical comparisons were carried out between super-enhancers and typical/stretch enhancers. These analyses demonstrate that super-enhancers are a unique subclass of enhancers, with distinct characteristics from typical enhancers and, more importantly, stretch enhancers.  

### Data access
- Super-enhancers and typical enhancers identified based on ChIP-seq data from the ENCODE project   
-- Super-enhancers  
-- Typical enhancers  

- Super-enhancers, Stretch enhancers, and typical enhancers in the ten extensively stuodies cell lines   
-- Super-enhancers  
-- Stretch enhancers  
-- Typical enhancers
