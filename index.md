# A core collection of super-enhancers with their unique charactheristics 

## Introduction
This repertoire contains a set of super-enhancers along with typical enhancers and stretch enhancers on selected cell-lines / tissues. In addition, a series of statistical comparisons were carried out between super-enhancers and typical/stretch enhancers. These analyses demonstrate that super-enhancers are a unique subclass of enhancers, with distinct characteristics from typical enhancers and, more importantly, stretch enhancers.  

## Data access
#### Super-enhancers and typical enhancers identified based on ChIP-seq data from the ENCODE project  
We collected the data and provide downloadings below: 
1. Super-enhancers [[SE Download]](files/)  
2. Typical enhancers [[TE Download]](files/)   
    
**Note**: Above are links for bulk downloadings, please check [here](html/test.html) for an additional table to download the data of individual cell types.     

#### Super-enhancers, stretch enhancers, and typical enhancers in the ten extensively studies cell lines  
We collected the data and provide downloadings below:

## Comparison to typical enhancers  
We compared the size and the number of SEs and typical enhancers (TE) in each cell type.  

#### SE vs TE: median size

## Comparison to stretch enhancers   
We compared the size and the number of SEs, stretch enhancers (StrE) and typical enhancers (TE) in each cell type.
